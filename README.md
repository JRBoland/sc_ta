# Technical Assessment for SeenCulture


To run the programs, clone this repo, navigate to the directory using the command line, and run `python problem_1.py` or `python problem_2.py` \
_Alternatively, run `python problem_1_user_input.py` to run the alternate solution for problem 1, which takes user input_

_Resources are given in more detail with the attached reflections on problems and approach:_ 
- [Reflections on problems and approach](reflection_on_problems_and_approach.pdf) 
- [Approach for problem 2](approach_problem_2.pdf)

_Note: Additional late files were added as alternate solutions that allow for user input, rather than using hardcoded input values as given in `problem_1.py` and `problem_1.py`. The logic for these late submissions stays the same apart from some minor changes to input values according to prompts given to user. If this is not allowed, please disregard these files._

- `problem_1_user_input.py` was uploaded at approx 6:50pm.
